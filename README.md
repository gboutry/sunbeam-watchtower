# Sunbeam Watchtower

A unified CLI dashboard for tracking packages, code, reviews, bugs, builds, and Launchpad project metadata across GitHub, Launchpad, and Gerrit forges.

Watchtower is moving toward a server-first runtime model. A persistent Watchtower server is the durable coordination boundary for auth, async operations, and future TUI/MCP clients, while the CLI remains a first-class frontend that can still perform local preparation and, when needed, start an ephemeral embedded server for single-command work. The codebase uses a hexagonal split where `internal/adapter/primary/*` drives `internal/app`, which wires `internal/core/service/*` to `internal/adapter/secondary/*` through `internal/core/port/*`. Public reusable contracts and helpers live under `pkg/`, notably `pkg/client`, `pkg/dto/v1`, `pkg/distro/v1`, `pkg/forge/v1`, and `pkg/launchpad/v1`.

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/gboutry/sunbeam-watchtower/cmd/watchtower@latest
```

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gboutry/sunbeam-watchtower.git
cd sunbeam-watchtower
go build -o watchtower ./cmd/watchtower
```

## Quick start

1. Create a configuration file at `~/.config/sunbeam-watchtower/config.yaml`:

```yaml
projects:
  - name: snap-openstack
    code:
      forge: github
      owner: canonical
      project: snap-openstack
    bugs:
      - forge: launchpad
        project: snap-openstack

  - name: sunbeam-charms
    code:
      forge: gerrit
      host: https://review.opendev.org
      project: openstack/sunbeam-charms

  - name: charm-keystone
    code:
      forge: launchpad
      project: charm-keystone-k8s
```

2. Sync the local caches:

```bash
watchtower cache sync
```

3. Start exploring:

```bash
watchtower packages diff released
watchtower commit log
watchtower review list
watchtower bug list
watchtower project sync --dry-run
```

## Architecture

- `cmd/watchtower` is a thin entrypoint into the CLI adapter.
- `internal/adapter/primary/cli` contains Cobra command logic.
- `internal/adapter/primary/api` exposes the application over HTTP/OpenAPI.
- `internal/adapter/primary/frontend` contains frontend-facing shared workflows such as local build preparation and async orchestration helpers.
- `internal/app` is the composition root used by the primary adapters.
- `internal/core/port` contains interfaces only.
- `internal/core/service/*` contains domain logic and use cases.
- `internal/adapter/secondary/*` contains concrete integrations for git, Launchpad, caches, and OpenStack.
- `pkg/*` contains reusable client and DTO packages that can be consumed outside the repository.

## Runtime model

Watchtower currently supports three workflow shapes:

1. `remote-only` workflows, where the server does the work directly
2. `local-only` workflows, where a frontend inspects local state
3. `split` workflows, where a frontend prepares local inputs and the server executes the durable remote part

Examples:

```bash
# Explicit external server
watchtower --server http://127.0.0.1:8472 operation list
WATCHTOWER_SERVER=http://127.0.0.1:8472 watchtower operation list

# Local persistent daemon managed by the CLI
watchtower server start
watchtower server status
watchtower operation list
watchtower server stop

# Split workflow: local checkout stays local, prepared LP refs go to the server
watchtower build trigger demo --source local --local-path .
```

For split workflows, the server never reads raw local paths. Frontends prepare a stable `prepared` build source payload and send that to the server.

The canonical prepared-build payload uses:

- `target_ref`
- `repository_ref`
- `recipes`

### Runtime resolution order

When a command needs the API, the CLI resolves the target in this order:

1. `--server`
2. `WATCHTOWER_SERVER`
3. discovered local daemon on the default Unix socket
4. auto-started local daemon for persistent workflows
5. one-command embedded server for explicitly ephemeral work

Persistent workflows currently include:

- `auth *`
- `operation *`
- `build trigger --async`
- `project sync --async`

The shared runtime policies are:

- CLI durable workflows use `require_persistent`
- CLI ordinary API commands use `prefer_existing_daemon`
- TUI startup uses `prefer_embedded` and upgrades interactively before durable actions

Stateless queries and one-shot commands can still run against the embedded server when no persistent target is configured.

## Configuration

The config file lives at `~/.config/sunbeam-watchtower/config.yaml` by default. Override with `--config <path>`.

### Top-level sections

| Section     | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `launchpad` | Launchpad settings (`default_owner`, `use_keyring`, default `series`, `development_focus`) |
| `github`    | GitHub settings (`use_keyring`) |
| `gerrit`    | Gerrit settings (`hosts` list with `url` entries) |
| `projects`  | List of tracked projects |
| `build`     | Build pipeline settings (`default_prefix`, `timeout_minutes`, `artifacts_dir`) |
| `packages`  | Package source, set, and upstream configuration |
| `otel`      | Server-side OpenTelemetry exporters and metrics listeners |

### OpenTelemetry

Telemetry is a persistent-server feature. It is designed to stay cheap by default:

- `otel.metrics.self` exposes request/runtime/collector-health metrics for the running server
- `otel.metrics.domain` exposes Watchtower domain metrics
- domain metrics default to cached/internal state
- live upstream fan-out is disabled unless you explicitly allow it with `otel.metrics.domain.live_systems`
- the intended production pattern is periodic cache refresh, for example from cron, plus Prometheus scraping the server

Example:

```yaml
otel:
  service_name: watchtower
  service_namespace: sunbeam
  metrics:
    self:
      enabled: true
      listen_addr: 127.0.0.1:9464
      path: /metrics
    domain:
      enabled: true
      listen_addr: 127.0.0.1:9465
      path: /metrics
      live_systems: []
    collectors:
      reviews:
        refresh_interval: 15m
  traces:
    enabled: true
    endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:4318
    protocol: http
  logs:
    enabled: true
    endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:4318
    protocol: http
    mirror_stderr: true
```

Operational model:

```bash
# Persistent server with telemetry
watchtower server start

# Periodic cache refresh keeps domain telemetry cheap
watchtower cache sync
watchtower cache sync releases
watchtower cache sync excuses
```

Label policy:

- use bounded labels only
- do not expect IDs, SHAs, usernames, or raw URLs as metric labels
- release metrics use stable labels such as `project`, `artifact_type`, `artifact`, `track`, `risk`, `branch`, `architecture`, and `resource`

### Project configuration

Each project has:

```yaml
- name: my-project              # required, unique identifier
  artifact_type: rock           # optional: rock, charm, or snap (required if build is set)
  code:
    forge: github               # required: github, gerrit, or launchpad
    owner: my-org               # required for github
    host: https://review.dev.org # required for gerrit
    project: my-project         # required: project name/path
    git_url: https://custom/repo # optional: explicit clone URL override
  bugs:
    - forge: launchpad
      project: my-project
  series:                       # optional: Launchpad series to ensure on the project
    - 2024.1
    - 2024.2
  development_focus: 2024.2     # optional: must be one of the declared series
  build:                        # optional
    owner: my-team
    official_codehosting: false # when true, use LP's default git repo for remote builds
    lp_project: my-lp-project  # LP project for recipe ops (defaults to code.project)
    artifacts:
      - recipe-name
    prepare_command: make prepare
```

When `official_codehosting` is `true`, remote builds resolve the project's default
git repository via the LP API (`GetDefaultRepository`) and create series-based
recipes automatically. The `lp_project` field overrides which LP project is used
for recipe operations (useful when the LP project name differs from `code.project`).

Example project configured for official remote builds:

```yaml
- name: ubuntu-openstack-rocks
  artifact_type: rock
  code:
    forge: github
    owner: canonical
    project: ubuntu-openstack-rocks
  build:
    owner: canonical
    official_codehosting: true
    lp_project: ubuntu-openstack-rocks
```

The `git_url` field is useful when the clone URL cannot be derived from the forge type and project name (e.g., Launchpad repos with complex paths like `~owner/project/+git/repo`).

Projects can declare the Launchpad series that must exist on the project, plus the desired focus of development:

```yaml
- name: snap-openstack
  code:
    forge: github
    owner: canonical
    project: snap-openstack
  bugs:
    - forge: launchpad
      project: snap-openstack
  series:
    - 2024.1
    - 2024.2
  development_focus: 2024.2
```

`watchtower project sync` ensures those series exist and sets the declared focus of development.

### Release tracking overrides

Published snap and charm tracking is repo-driven:

- snap names come from `snap/snapcraft.yaml` or root `snapcraft.yaml`
- charm names and resources come from `charmcraft.yaml`
- tracked store tracks default to the project's `series`

Use `project.release` only for store-specific overrides:

```yaml
- name: snap-openstack
  artifact_type: snap
  code:
    forge: github
    owner: canonical
    project: snap-openstack
  series:
    - 2024.1
    - 2025.1
  release:
    track_map:
      2025.1: latest
    branches:
      - series: 2024.1
        branch: risc-v
        risks: [edge, beta, candidate, stable]

- name: sunbeam-charms
  artifact_type: charm
  code:
    forge: gerrit
    host: https://review.opendev.org
    project: openstack/sunbeam-charms
  series:
    - 2024.1
  release:
    branches:
      - series: 2024.1
        branch: risc-v
        risks: [edge]
    skip_artifacts:
      - sunbeam-libs
```

Rules:

- `release.track_map` remaps project `series` to store tracks
- `release.tracks` can replace the default series-derived tracks entirely
- `release.branches` declares managed `track/risk/branch` channels for snaps or charms
- `release.skip_artifacts` excludes discovered artifacts that exist in a mono repo but are not meant to be published or tracked
- branch channels are additive; Watchtower does not try to auto-discover arbitrary store branches as managed release lines

### Release target visibility profiles

Release tracking always stores and serves the full target matrix. Target filtering is a frontend-side presentation feature for `watchtower releases` and the TUI.

Use top-level reusable profiles plus optional per-project defaults and overrides:

```yaml
releases:
  default_target_profile: noble-and-newer
  target_profiles:
    noble-and-newer:
      include:
        - base_names: [ubuntu]
          min_base_channel: "24.04"

projects:
  - name: openstack
    artifact_type: charm
    code:
      forge: gerrit
      host: https://review.opendev.org
      project: openstack/sunbeam-charms
    release:
      target_profile: noble-and-newer
      target_profile_overrides:
        exclude:
          - architectures: [s390x]
```

Rules:

- `releases.default_target_profile` sets the default frontend filter when no project-specific or per-invocation profile is chosen
- `releases.target_profiles` defines named include/exclude rules for release targets
- `release.target_profile` selects the default named profile for one project
- `release.target_profile_overrides` merges on top of the selected profile for that project
- `min_base_channel` accepts dotted numeric version channels only, such as `22.04` or `24.04`
- snap targets using `core22`/`core24`/`core26` are normalized against Ubuntu generations for `min_base_channel` matching
- `--all-targets` bypasses all local filtering for that command or TUI session state
- filtering affects rendered output only; server state and API payloads remain unchanged

## Commands

### `watchtower releases`

Inspect cached snap and charm release matrices with target-aware revision output.

When a snap and a charm share the same artifact name, Watchtower tracks and lists both entries separately. Use `--type` with `releases show` when a name matches multiple artifact types.

```bash
# List cached release rows with target-qualified revisions
watchtower releases list openstack

# Filter locally to a named target profile
watchtower releases list openstack --target-profile noble-and-newer

# Show the full matrix for one artifact
watchtower releases show openstack --type snap

# Bypass local filtering and show every tracked target
watchtower releases show openstack --type snap --all-targets
```

### `watchtower packages`

Compare package versions and inspect package metadata across configured distro sources.

```bash
# Compare package sets
watchtower packages diff released

# Show all versions of a package
watchtower packages show-version nova

# Show full APT metadata for a specific version
watchtower packages show nova 2:2025.1-0ubuntu1

# Show highest version matching filters
watchtower packages show nova --distro ubuntu --backport gazpacho

# List Ubuntu proposed-migration excuses
watchtower packages excuses list --tracker ubuntu --ftbfs

# Filter Ubuntu excuses by owning team
watchtower packages excuses list --tracker ubuntu --team debcrafters-packages

# Inspect one package's migration blockers
watchtower packages excuses show nova --tracker ubuntu

# List packages in a configured distro release
watchtower packages list --distro ubuntu --release noble
```

### `watchtower commit`

Read commit history from the local git cache.

```bash
# List recent commits across all projects
watchtower commit log

# Filter by project, forge, branch, or author
watchtower commit log --project snap-openstack --branch main --author alice

# Find commits referencing a Launchpad bug
watchtower commit track --bug-id 12345
```

### `watchtower review`

List and inspect cached merge requests across forges. Review browsing is cache-first by default, so run `watchtower cache sync reviews` before relying on `review list/show` in the CLI or TUI.

```bash
# List open merge requests
watchtower cache sync reviews
watchtower review list --state open

# Filter by project or forge
watchtower review list --project snap-openstack --forge github

# List MRs updated in the last week
watchtower review list --since 1w

# Show details for a specific merge request
watchtower review show --project snap-openstack "#42"

# Refresh cached detail for recently updated closed reviews too
watchtower cache sync reviews --since 30d
```

### `watchtower bug`

Track bugs across Launchpad bug trackers.

```bash
# List bug tasks
watchtower bug list

# Filter by status, importance, assignee, or tag
watchtower bug list --status "In Progress" --importance High --assignee alice

# Show a specific bug with its tasks
watchtower bug show 12345
```

### `watchtower build`

Manage Launchpad builds (rocks, charms, snaps). Two build modes are supported:

- **Local** (`--source local`): pushes the local git tree to a temporary LP repo,
  creates temporary recipes, and triggers builds. Ideal for development and testing.
- **Remote** (`--source remote`): uses the project's official LP git repo (code
  mirror) and creates series-based recipes. Used for official builds.

```bash
# Local build (development) — push local tree and trigger
watchtower build trigger --source local ubuntu-openstack-rocks nova-consolidated keystone

# Remote build (official, series-based)
watchtower build trigger --source remote ubuntu-openstack-rocks nova-consolidated keystone

# Trigger and wait for completion
watchtower build trigger my-project --wait --timeout 2h

# Trigger and wait, then download artifacts
watchtower build trigger my-project --wait --download

# List builds
watchtower build list my-project

# List local builds by prefix
watchtower build list --source local ubuntu-openstack-rocks --prefix tmp-build-

# Download build artifacts
watchtower build download my-project --artifacts-dir ./output

# Download specific artifacts from a local build
watchtower build download --source local ubuntu-openstack-rocks keystone nova-consolidated

# Clean up temporary recipes
watchtower build cleanup my-project --dry-run
```

In remote mode with series configured, each artifact expands into per-series
recipes: `<artifact>` for the dev-focus series (default branch) and
`<artifact>-<series>` for other series (`stable/<series>` branch).

### `watchtower project`

Manage Launchpad project metadata derived from configuration.

```bash
# Preview Launchpad project changes
watchtower project sync --dry-run

# Sync a subset of Launchpad projects
watchtower project sync --project snap-openstack --project sunbeam-charms
```

### `watchtower cache`

Manage local caches used by commit tracking, package lookups, upstream repository inspection, bug tracking, release tracking, and review browsing.

```bash
# Sync all cache types
watchtower cache sync

# Sync only git repos
watchtower cache sync git

# Sync only package indexes for selected distros/releases
watchtower cache sync packages-index --distro ubuntu --release noble

# Sync only configured upstream repos
watchtower cache sync upstream-repos

# Sync only bug/task caches
watchtower cache sync bugs

# Sync cached review summaries and details
watchtower cache sync reviews

# Sync Ubuntu and Debian excuses caches
watchtower cache sync excuses --tracker ubuntu --tracker debian

# Sync Ubuntu excuses and refresh the companion team mapping used by --team
watchtower cache sync excuses --tracker ubuntu

# Sync a specific project's git cache
watchtower cache sync git --project snap-openstack

# Sync only one project's review cache
watchtower cache sync reviews --project snap-openstack

# Show cached repos and their disk usage
watchtower cache status

# Remove all cached data
watchtower cache clear

# Remove a specific project's git cache
watchtower cache clear git --project snap-openstack

# Remove only Debian excuses cache entries
watchtower cache clear excuses --tracker debian
```

Valid cache types are `git`, `packages-index`, `upstream-repos`, `bugs`, `excuses`, `releases`, and `reviews`.

Review cache data is stored at `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/sunbeam-watchtower/reviews/` (defaults to `~/.cache/sunbeam-watchtower/reviews/`). It stores cached review summaries for all synced items plus full comments/files/diff detail for open reviews and recently updated closed reviews.

Git cache data is stored at `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/sunbeam-watchtower/repos/` (defaults to `~/.cache/sunbeam-watchtower/repos/`). Repos are bare git clones organized by host:

```
~/.cache/sunbeam-watchtower/repos/
├── github.com/canonical/snap-openstack.git
├── review.opendev.org/openstack/sunbeam-charms.git
└── git.launchpad.net/charm-keystone-k8s.git
```

### `watchtower auth`

Manage Launchpad authentication. Required for bug tracking, reviews on Launchpad, and builds.

```bash
# Interactive browser-based OAuth login
watchtower auth login

# Check authentication status
watchtower auth status
```

### `watchtower config`

```bash
# Display the current configuration
watchtower config show
```

### `watchtower serve`

Run the HTTP API server directly instead of using the embedded per-command server.

```bash
# Serve on TCP
watchtower serve --listen 127.0.0.1:8472

# Serve on a Unix domain socket
watchtower serve --listen unix:///tmp/watchtower.sock
```

When served over TCP:

- OpenAPI spec: `http://127.0.0.1:8472/openapi.json`
- Interactive docs: `http://127.0.0.1:8472/docs`

## Output formats

All list/show commands support `--output` (`-o`):

| Format  | Flag            | Description |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| Table   | `-o table`      | Human-readable aligned columns (default) |
| JSON    | `-o json`       | Machine-readable JSON |
| YAML    | `-o yaml`       | Machine-readable YAML |

## Global flags

| Flag        | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `--config`  | Path to config file (default: `~/.config/sunbeam-watchtower/config.yaml`) |
| `--verbose` | Enable debug logging (CLI/API write to stderr; TUI shows logs in its log pane) |
| `-o, --output` | Output format: `table`, `json`, `yaml` |
| `--no-color` | Disable colored output |

## Debug logging

Enable verbose logging to see exactly what watchtower is doing:

```bash
watchtower --verbose commit log
```

For CLI and API runs, this writes structured debug logs to stderr, including:
- Which forge clients are being configured
- Which projects are being queried or skipped by filters
- How many commits/reviews/bugs were fetched per project
- Git cache operations (clone, fetch, path resolution)
- Cache directory resolution

For `watchtower-tui`, `--verbose` enables the same debug logs but keeps them inside the TUI. Press `l` to open the log pane, which shows the current session logs and, when connected to the local persistent daemon, a tail of the daemon log file.

Example output:

```
time=... level=DEBUG msg="building commit sources" project_count=3

```

## Developer tooling

This repository ships with pre-commit hooks, `arch-go` architecture checks, and a curated `golangci-lint` v2 configuration.

```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

The hooks run whitespace/YAML checks plus `arch-go`, `golangci-lint`, `go build`, `go test`, changed-package coverage via `go run ./tools/coverageguard --config .coverage-policy.yaml`, and `go mod tidy`.

GitHub Actions runs the same contract in CI: repo-wide quality checks plus changed-package coverage against the pull request diff.
