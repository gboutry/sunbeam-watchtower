# Sunbeam Watchtower — Plan

## Foreword

You LLM reader, these next section (up to bug correlation included) are the original plan for Watchtower. You are not allowed to edit them, but you can read them for context. The "Current architecture" section and everything below is a summary of the recent refactor outcomes, which you can edit and update as needed.

## Goal of the project

Watchtower is a unified tracking and management tool for Canonical OpenStack (Sunbeam) across its full lifecycle — development, release, and maintenance. It integrates with git repos, bug trackers, build systems, and package archives to provide a single pane of glass for monitoring project health, synchronizing data, and triggering actions.

### Why Watchtower exists

Canonical OpenStack (based on Sunbeam) is a complex ecosystem composed of many build artifacts spread across multiple forges, bug trackers, and git repositories. A single Sunbeam deployment involves:

| Artifact type    | Count | Description                                                        |
|------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Packages         | many  | APT metadata, source packages, and binary packages                 |
| Rocks            | 40+   | OCI images built from Ubuntu packages                              |
| Snaps            | 5+    | Snap packages built from Ubuntu packages                           |
| Charms           | 40+   | Juju operators that manage the Rocks and Snaps                     |
| snap-openstack   | 1     | Orchestration layer that ties everything together                  |

This adds up to hundreds of individually tracked items. Without a unified tool, monitoring and managing them requires manual coordination across many separate systems. Watchtower eliminates that burden.

### Scope and design constraints

1. **General-purpose core, Sunbeam-specific adapters.** The API and core services are not Sunbeam-specific. Any software ecosystem with similar complexity (many artifacts, multiple forges, multiple trackers) should be manageable through Watchtower. All Canonical OpenStack–specific logic lives in the adapter layer; core services and ports remain forge-agnostic and reusable.

2. **Forge-pluggable architecture.** Launchpad is the primary forge today (bug tracker, build system). The architecture must allow adding other forges (GitHub, Gerrit, etc.) without changing the core application logic.

3. **Hexagonal architecture.** Ports define interfaces; services implement domain logic; adapters bridge external systems. Primary adapters (API, CLI) and secondary adapters (Launchpad, git, caches) never cross-import.

### Features in scope for the initial implementation

- **Unified query API** — package metadata, bug status, build status, project health, and migration excuses from a single endpoint surface.
- **Cache synchronization** — local caches synced with upstream data sources (git repos, bug trackers, build systems, package archives, excuses feeds).
- **Build triggering** — request, monitor, retry, cancel, and download builds via the API and CLI.
- **CLI** — command-line interface for common operations (sync, build trigger, status checks, cache management).
- **Authentication and credential management** — OAuth and credential flows for upstream services (Launchpad today; extensible to others).

### Bug correlation (high-priority feature)

The bug correlation system is one of the most important features. Its purpose is to identify where a bug was fixed (which commit, which repo, which artifact) and ensure the fix is properly recorded in the relevant trackers. This is critical for maintaining Canonical OpenStack, where a single upstream fix may need to be tracked across multiple packages, charms, and rocks. The system must be accurate and reliable, as incorrect or missing correlation directly impacts release quality.

## Current architecture

Sunbeam Watchtower now follows a stricter hexagonal layout:

- **Entrypoint**: `cmd/watchtower`
- **Primary adapters**: `internal/adapter/primary/api`, `internal/adapter/primary/cli`, and `internal/adapter/primary/frontend`
- **Composition root**: `internal/app`
- **Core ports**: `internal/core/port` (interfaces only)
- **Core services**: `internal/core/service/*`
- **Secondary adapters**: `internal/adapter/secondary/*`
- **Public reusable packages**: `pkg/client`, `pkg/dto/v1`, `pkg/distro/v1`, `pkg/forge/v1`, `pkg/launchpad/v1`
- **Configuration loading**: `internal/config`

The practical request from this refactor is in place:

- reusable DTOs and client-facing contracts live under `pkg/`
- `internal/core/service/*` depends only on `internal/core/port/*` and `pkg/*`
- `internal/core/port/*` contains interfaces only
- primary adapters do not import secondary adapters directly
- public `pkg/*` code no longer imports `internal/*`
- `internal/app` remains the shared wiring layer used by the CLI and HTTP API

## Package layout

```

The tree above is intentionally summarized. The current codebase also includes:

- `internal/adapter/primary/frontend` for frontend-facing async workflow helpers
- `internal/adapter/secondary/authflowstore` for pending auth-flow persistence
- `internal/adapter/secondary/credentials` for Launchpad credential persistence
- `internal/adapter/secondary/excusescache` for migration-excuses caching
- `internal/adapter/secondary/operationstore` for long-running operation persistence
- `internal/core/service/auth` for application-surface authentication workflows
- `internal/core/service/operation` for long-running operation orchestration

## Architecture rules enforced in CI

- `arch-go` enforces the package dependency model above with 100% compliance and coverage.
- `depguard` mirrors the same boundaries in `golangci-lint`:
  - `cmd/watchtower` enters through primary adapters only
  - primary adapters do not import secondary adapters
  - core services do not import adapters, config, or app wiring
  - secondary adapters do not import primary adapters or core services
  - public `pkg/*` packages stay independent from `internal/*`
- `internal/adapter/*` packages are implementation packages and must not define interfaces.
- `internal/core/port/*` is reserved for interfaces only.

## API surface

The HTTP API remains the application boundary for non-CLI consumers.

- `GET /openapi.json` — OpenAPI 3.1 spec
- `GET /docs` — interactive docs UI
- `GET /api/v1/health` — health check
- `GET /api/v1/auth/status`
- `POST /api/v1/auth/launchpad/begin`
- `POST /api/v1/auth/launchpad/finalize`
- `POST /api/v1/auth/launchpad/logout`
- `GET /api/v1/packages/*` / `POST /api/v1/packages/cache/sync`
  - `GET /api/v1/packages/detail/{name}` — full APT metadata for a package
  - `GET /api/v1/packages/excuses` / `GET /api/v1/packages/excuses/{name}` — normalized migration excuses from Ubuntu/Debian trackers
- `GET /api/v1/bugs*` / `POST /api/v1/bugs/sync`
- `GET /api/v1/reviews*`
- `GET /api/v1/commits*`
- `POST /api/v1/builds/*` / `GET /api/v1/builds`
- `POST /api/v1/projects/sync`
- `POST /api/v1/cache/sync/git` / `POST /api/v1/cache/sync/upstream` / `POST /api/v1/cache/sync/bugs` / `POST /api/v1/cache/sync/excuses`
- `DELETE /api/v1/cache/{type}` (git, packages-index, upstream-repos, bugs, excuses)
- `GET /api/v1/cache/status`
- `GET /api/v1/config`

## Runtime model

Watchtower is now explicitly moving toward a **server-first runtime model**:

- a dedicated Watchtower server is the long-term durable coordination boundary
- future TUI and MCP surfaces are expected to reuse the same server/API
- the CLI remains a first-class tool, not just a thin HTTP wrapper
- some workflows are intentionally split between local preparation and remote execution
- the CLI may still spawn a local embedded server for convenience, but that is a runtime mode, not the primary architecture

Watchtower workflows therefore fall into three categories:

1. **Remote-only workflows**
   - pure API queries
   - server-managed syncs
   - auth state
   - durable async operations
2. **Local-only workflows**
   - inspecting a local checkout
   - reading local workspace state
   - deriving artifact metadata from a local tree
3. **Split workflows**
   - local preparation happens on the client side
   - prepared references are then sent to the server for durable remote execution
   - example: `build --source local --local-path ...`, where the local side prepares Launchpad git/repo/ref state and the server then creates recipes, requests builds, and tracks execution

For split workflows, the server must never require raw local filesystem access. Local paths stay local; the shared contract is the prepared forge/build reference produced by local preparation.

Two runtime modes are expected to coexist:

1. **Persistent server mode**
   - used by the dedicated daemon/server process
   - supports resumable auth flows, durable async operations, and multi-client workflows
   - is the target mode for MCP, TUI, and advanced CLI usage
2. **Ephemeral embedded mode**
   - used when the CLI starts a short-lived local server for one command
   - suitable for stateless or single-command work
   - must not pretend to offer durable auth-flow or async-operation semantics across invocations

This distinction is important: stateful features must be designed around persistent-server semantics first, then degraded or disabled explicitly in ephemeral mode. At the same time, local preparation must remain reusable outside the CLI adapter so future frontends such as the TUI can perform the same split-workflow preparation without duplicating command code.

## Recent refactor outcomes

- migrated the old `internal/api`, `internal/cli`, `internal/service`, and `internal/port` layout into the new `internal/adapter/*` and `internal/core/*` split
- moved reusable client and contract packages to root `pkg/`
- introduced public config DTOs under `pkg/dto/v1`, so `pkg/client` no longer leaks `internal/config`
- removed the remaining core-service boundary leak by making bug sync consume `port.CommitSource` instead of commit-service types
- preserved existing command and API behavior while tightening architecture linting
- moved Launchpad auth behind core ports and an `internal/core/service/auth` application service
- added Launchpad auth API/client flows with server-side pending auth state, opaque flow IDs, and no token secrets in API DTOs
- made CLI `auth login|status|logout` a thin adapter over the application/API auth surface instead of directly owning OAuth + credential persistence
- added direct adapter tests for Launchpad credential persistence, pending auth flow storage, and the Launchpad auth adapter so the new auth boundary has focused secondary-adapter coverage
- added HTTP tests for the Launchpad auth API endpoints so begin/finalize/logout/status flows now have primary-adapter coverage too
- added focused Launchpad repo/project manager tests covering current-user lookup, default-repo fallback, project/repo create-or-reuse flows, git-ref resolution, project series handling, and development-focus updates
- added focused Launchpad snap/charm/rock builder tests covering recipe creation/listing, build requests, build listing, artifact URL lookup, and retry/cancel/delete actions
- added primary-adapter tests for build/cache/project endpoints covering build-list success, invalid timeout validation, invalid excuses tracker validation, cache-status wiring, and project-sync auth-required handling
- added CLI execution tests for `auth login|status|logout` plus a build-list rendering path backed by a stubbed HTTP API
- moved split-workflow build triggering onto a first-class `prepared` contract so local preparation no longer leaks raw Launchpad repo/ref/path fields at the top level of the trigger API
- synced `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` with the current runtime model, split-workflow terminology, and shared frontend preparation layer
- added an initial local persistent-server lifecycle in the CLI: `server start|status|stop`, Unix-socket local daemon discovery, explicit server/daemon/embedded resolution order, and automatic daemon startup for persistent workflows such as auth and async operations
- hardened the local daemon lifecycle with metadata persistence, stale socket/pid detection, and cleanup semantics so repeated CLI/agent invocations can reason about local server state more safely
- moved build command orchestration behind a reusable frontend build workflow so local preparation plus remote trigger/list/download flows are no longer encoded directly in Cobra handlers
- decomposed `internal/app` bootstrap logic into focused build/project/review/package wiring files, with targeted tests on config-to-service resolution paths, so future refactors do not need to edit one monolithic composition file
- defined initial restart semantics for persisted operations: queued/running jobs are now reconciled to an explicit `interrupted` terminal state on service startup, with deterministic recovery events, instead of remaining misleadingly in-flight forever
- added dedicated frontend auth and operation workflows so API/frontends stop reaching into `internal/app` for those concerns service-by-service, and the existing async build/project frontend wrapper now layers on top of the operation workflow instead of duplicating that access pattern
- added real daemon integration coverage for the CLI by re-entering the command surface through a helper subprocess, so `server start/status/stop`, auth persistence, and async operation persistence are verified across separate CLI invocations against an actual background server process
- added a machine-enforced changed-package coverage guard (`tools/coverageguard` + `.coverage-policy.yaml`) and wired it into `pre-commit`, so package-level coverage floors become part of the merge contract instead of an informal expectation
- ratcheted `.coverage-policy.yaml` with explicit per-package floors for core packages (`internal/config`, `internal/core/service/auth`, build/operation services, CLI, and durable stores) and raised auth-service test coverage so the policy follows measured quality instead of a single loose default

## Validation

The intended validation baseline for the refactor is:

- `go test ./...`
- `golangci-lint run ./...`
- `arch-go --color no`
- `go run ./tools/coverageguard --config .coverage-policy.yaml $(git diff --cached --name-only -- '*.go')`
- `pre-commit run --all-files`

Architecture boundaries are currently validated by `arch-go` with 100% compliance and coverage.

Some local test runs may still depend on host/runtime conditions (for example loopback listener availability or inherited git signing configuration). Those cases should be treated as test-environment hardening work, not as architecture-boundary failures.

The Huma request-contract hardening pass has started: optional query/body slice and bool fields are now being normalized with explicit `required:"false"` tags, with regression tests added for omitted-parameter behavior so frontend/API contracts do not drift again.

The split-workflow build refactor has also started: local Launchpad/git preparation is moving out of Cobra handlers into a reusable frontend-side preparation layer so CLI and future TUI work can share the same local-preparation logic without pushing filesystem concerns into the server.

Durable server-side state work has started too: pending auth flows and long-running operations are now moving behind bbolt-backed secondary adapters so a persistent Watchtower server can keep coordination state across process lifetimes instead of relying only on in-memory stores.

Runtime mode selection is now being made explicit as well: persistent server mode is the place where durable coordination state lives, while explicitly ephemeral frontend mode continues to use memory-backed state for short-lived embedded workflows.

The runtime resolution model has now started to move from documentation into code as well: the CLI first honors `--server` / `WATCHTOWER_SERVER`, then reuses a discovered local daemon on the default Unix socket, then auto-starts that local daemon for persistent workflows, and only falls back to an embedded one-command server for explicitly ephemeral work.

## Deferred contract-test plan

We are **not** adopting broad go-vcr coverage now.

If we later add cassette-backed contract tests, keep them deliberately small and easy to refresh:

- scope them to a handful of high-value `pkg/launchpad/v1` or `pkg/forge/v1` client methods whose real payloads are hard to model with `httptest`
- prefer read-only or safely repeatable endpoints first; avoid OAuth handshakes and destructive write flows
- store cassettes under package-local `testdata/vcr/`
- default tests to replay mode in normal `go test` / CI runs
- enable re-recording only behind an explicit env var such as `WATCHTOWER_RECORD=1`
- when implemented, add a single helper script (for example `hack/rerecord-contract-tests.sh`) so cassette refresh is one command rather than a manual sequence
- redact or normalize auth headers, OAuth parameters, cookies, timestamps, and request IDs before saving cassettes so diffs stay reviewable

## Contributor readiness

- `README.md` — up-to-date with current architecture and commands
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — synced with hexagonal layout, dependency rules, and architecture guidelines
- `AGENTS.md` — Launchpad API quirks for AI agent consumers
- `arch-go.yml` + `.golangci.yml` — machine-enforced boundaries (zero manual review burden)

## CLI cache types

The CLI `cache sync|clear|status` subcommands support the following cache types:

- `git` — local git repo mirrors
- `packages-index` — APT package sources
- `upstream-repos` — upstream OpenStack repos
- `bugs` — bug/task caches from forges (Launchpad, etc.)
- `excuses` — normalized migration excuses from Ubuntu/Debian tracker feeds

All five types are wired through `internal/adapter/primary/cli/cache.go` and rendered
via `internal/adapter/primary/cli/output.go`.

## Excuses integration

Watchtower now includes a first packaging-focused integration for migration excuses:

- **CLI**:
  - `packages excuses list`
  - `packages excuses show <package>`
  - `cache sync excuses`
  - `cache clear excuses`
- **API**:
  - `GET /api/v1/packages/excuses`
  - `GET /api/v1/packages/excuses/{name}`
  - `POST /api/v1/cache/sync/excuses`
- **Providers**:
  - `ubuntu` → `update_excuses.yaml.xz` + `update_excuses_by_team.yaml`
  - `debian` → `excuses.yaml`

The implementation keeps excuses in a dedicated cache domain (`ExcusesCache`) rather
than overloading `DistroCache`. Raw tracker files are stored on disk and normalized
records are indexed in bbolt for fast list/show queries. For Ubuntu, cache sync also
fetches the companion `update_excuses_by_team.yaml` feed so `packages excuses list
--team ...` and `packages excuses show ...` can surface ownership information.

Excuses sources are now intended to live under each distro config (`packages.distros.*.excuses`),
with `provider`, `url`, and optional `team_url`. Compression is auto-detected from the
downloaded payload instead of being configured explicitly.

## Bug cache architecture

The bug cache uses a **decorator pattern**: `CachedBugTracker` wraps the live `BugTracker`
port and a `BugCache` port. On miss, the decorator falls through to the live tracker and
back-fills the cache; on hit, it serves directly from the local bbolt store.

- **Port**: `internal/core/port/bugcache.go` — defines the `BugCache` interface
- **Adapter**: `internal/adapter/secondary/bugcache/` — bbolt-backed implementation
- **Decorator**: `internal/adapter/secondary/bugcache/tracker.go` — `CachedBugTracker`

## Test coverage

### Bug cache (`internal/adapter/secondary/bugcache/`)

- `cache_test.go` — tests for the bbolt storage layer (`Cache`): store/get bugs, store/list tasks, filtering, last-sync round-trip, remove, remove-all, status, and cache-dir.
- `tracker_test.go` — tests for the `CachedBugTracker` decorator: cache-miss fallback, post-sync cache hits, write-through status updates, type delegation, and pass-through for GetProjectSeries/GetProject.

## ProjectBuilder series support

`ProjectBuilder` (`internal/core/service/build/project_builder.go`) now carries
series-aware fields alongside the original code-project metadata:

| Field                 | Purpose                                                       |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `LPProject`           | LP project for recipe operations (may differ from `Project`) |
| `Series`              | Series this project builds for (e.g. `["2024.1", "2025.1"]`) |
| `DevFocus`            | Development-focus series (e.g. `"2025.1"`)                   |
| `OfficialCodehosting` | Whether the project uses LP's official code mirror           |

`RecipeProject()` helper returns `LPProject` when set, falling back to `Project`.

All callers in `Trigger()`, `assessRecipe()`, `executeAction()`, `List()`,
`Download()`, and `Cleanup()` use `pb.RecipeProject()`.

## RepoManager port

The `port.RepoManager` interface (`internal/core/port/build.go`) abstracts the
temporary git repo / branch lifecycle on Launchpad:

1. `GetCurrentUser(ctx)` — returns the authenticated LP username via `client.Me`.
2. `GetDefaultRepo(ctx, projectName)` — returns the default git repo self-link and default branch for a project.
3. `GetOrCreateProject(ctx, owner)` — ensures a `-sunbeam-remote-build` project exists.
4. `GetOrCreateRepo(ctx, owner, project, repoName)` — ensures a git repo exists.
5. `GetGitRef(ctx, repoSelfLink, refPath)` — fetches a git ref.
6. `WaitForGitRef(ctx, repoSelfLink, refPath, timeout)` — polls until a ref appears.

The sole implementation lives in `internal/adapter/secondary/launchpad/repo_manager.go`.

## ArtifactStrategy series-aware naming

`ArtifactStrategy` (`internal/core/service/build/strategy.go`) now exposes two
series-aware helpers used by callers that create or look up recipes:

| Method              | Signature                                              | Behaviour                                                                 |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `OfficialRecipeName`| `(artifactName, series, devFocus string) string`       | Returns `artifactName` for the dev-focus series; `artifactName-series` otherwise |
| `BranchForSeries`   | `(series, devFocus, defaultBranch string) string`      | Returns `defaultBranch` for the dev-focus series; `stable/<series>` otherwise    |

All three concrete strategies (`RockStrategy`, `CharmStrategy`, `SnapStrategy`)
share the same implementation today. Individual strategies can override the
behaviour independently in the future.

## Config: build settings

Per-project build configuration is described in the
[Build system design → Configuration](#configuration) section above.

## Terminology: projects, artifacts, and recipes

The build system uses three distinct concepts:

| Term         | Scope        | Description                                                                     |
|--------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Project**  | User-facing  | Top-level entity configured in `watchtower.yaml` (e.g. `ubuntu-openstack-rocks`)|
| **Artifact** | User-facing  | A buildable unit within a project (e.g. `keystone`, `nova-consolidated`)        |
| **Recipe**   | LP internal  | A Launchpad object created to build an artifact; includes prefix/SHA/series info|

**User-facing surfaces** (CLI positional args, config YAML, API input fields, client options)
use "artifact" terminology. **Internal implementation** (RecipeBuilder port, LP API calls,
recipe prefix/name filtering, output table `RECIPE` column) uses "recipe" because it refers
to the LP object directly.

CLI examples:
- `build trigger <project> [artifacts...]` — request builds for specific artifacts
- `build list [projects...]` — list builds (output shows recipe names in RECIPE column)
- `build download <project> [artifacts...]` — download build results
- `build cleanup [projects...]` — delete LP recipe objects (explicitly about recipes)

## Build system design

The build system supports two distinct modes: **local** (development/testing) and
**remote** (official builds).

### Local mode (`--source local`)
- **All git + LP setup runs in the CLI adapter** (`internal/adapter/primary/cli/build.go`),
  before any API call. The service and API never see filesystem paths.
- The CLI resolves the LP owner from the authenticated user via `repoManager.GetCurrentUser()`.
- Pushes local git HEAD to a temporary LP repo/branch (both `main` and `tmp-<sha>`).
- Computes temp recipe names, build paths, and git ref links locally.
- Calls the API with pre-resolved LP resource identifiers:
  `RepoSelfLink`, `GitRefLinks`, `BuildPaths`, `LPProject`, `Owner`.
- The service receives these and creates recipes / requests builds — no git operations.
- The `port.GitClient` dependency has been removed from the build service.

### Remote mode (`--source remote`)
- Uses the project's official LP git repo (code mirror) discovered via
  `repoManager.GetDefaultRepo(ctx, projectName)`.
- Creates official recipes on a per-series basis:
  - **Dev-focus series**: recipe named `<artifact>`, built from the default branch.
  - **Other series**: recipe named `<artifact>-<series>`, built from `stable/<series>`.
- `ArtifactStrategy.OfficialRecipeName(artifactName, series, devFocus)` and
  `ArtifactStrategy.BranchForSeries(series, devFocus, defaultBranch)` encapsulate
  the naming and branch logic.
- If no series are configured, all recipes use the default branch.
- Build paths use the artifact name (without series suffix).
- When `OfficialCodehosting` is false (legacy): expects recipes to already exist;
  no git repo resolution or recipe creation is performed.

### Owner resolution
1. `opts.Owner` (CLI flag `--owner`) takes precedence.
2. Falls back to `pb.Owner` from config.
3. **Local mode only (CLI)**: if still empty, resolves via `repoManager.GetCurrentUser()`.
4. Returns an error if owner is still empty.

### Configuration

Per-project build settings live in `ProjectBuildConfig`:

| Field                 | YAML key                | Purpose                                                          |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Owner`               | `owner`                 | LP owner for recipe operations (optional for local-only builds)  |
| `Artifacts`           | `artifacts`             | Explicit artifact names to build                                 |
| `PrepareCommand`      | `prepare_command`       | Shell command run before each build                              |
| `OfficialCodehosting` | `official_codehosting`  | When true, use LP's default git repo for remote builds           |
| `LPProject`           | `lp_project`            | LP project name for recipe ops (defaults to code.project)        |

`build.owner` is only required when `official_codehosting` is true.
For local-only builds the owner is resolved at runtime via the LP `Me()` API.

### `executeAction` details
- Accepts per-recipe `gitRefLink` and `buildPath` parameters.
- Recipe creation is gated on having valid git ref info (not just source mode).
- Uses `pb.RecipeProject()` for all LP project references.

### Build service test coverage

- `strategy_test.go` — tests for all three strategies (`RockStrategy`, `CharmStrategy`,
  `SnapStrategy`): `ArtifactType`, `MetadataFileName`, `BuildPath`, `ParsePlatforms`,
  `TempRecipeName`, `OfficialRecipeName`, and `BranchForSeries`.
- `service_test.go` — tests for `Trigger()`:
  - Remote mode: request-builds, all-succeeded, retry-failed, monitor-active, create-recipe,
    official-repo series expansion, failure without `OfficialCodehosting`, multiple recipes.
  - Pre-resolved mode: full pipeline with pre-resolved LP resources, owner override.
  - `ProjectBuilder.RecipeProject()` fallback logic.
  - `List()`: active-only, all-builds, project filter, graceful degradation, sorting.

### Build listing and download modes

Both `build list` and `build download` share the same discovery parameters:

| Flag            | Purpose                                               |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `--source`      | `remote` (default) or `local`                         |
| `--sha`         | Narrow prefix to a specific commit (`<prefix><sha>-`) |
| `--prefix`      | Recipe name prefix (default `tmp-build-`)             |
| `--owner`       | Override LP owner                                     |
| `--project`     | Filter by project name (also positional args)         |
| `--artifacts-dir` | (download only) Output directory                    |

**Listing modes:**

1. **Remote** (`--source remote`, default): Lists builds for configured project recipes.
2. **Local with SHA** (`--source local --sha <commit>`): Discovers recipes matching
   `<prefix><sha>-` via `findByOwner`, narrowing to an exact commit.
3. **Local with prefix** (`--source local` without `--sha`): Discovers all recipes matching
   `--prefix` (default `tmp-build-`) via `findByOwner`.

**Download** uses the same discovery logic: in local mode it resolves the LP owner and
project automatically, discovers recipes by prefix, and downloads artifacts from all
succeeded builds.

The prefix-based discovery is implemented via:
- `RecipeBuilder.ListRecipesByOwner(ctx, owner)` port method
- LP's `findByOwner` web-service operation on `+rock-recipes`, `+charm-recipes`, `+snaps`
- Client-side filtering by prefix and LP project in `Service.List()` / `Service.Download()`

### Remaining follow-ups

These are still the main gaps before TUI and MCP work:

- Launchpad auth now has an application/API surface, but it is still Launchpad-only; future work should extend the same model to GitHub/Gerrit when authenticated workflows are needed
- the runtime contract between persistent-server mode and ephemeral embedded mode must be made explicit in the CLI, docs, and store implementations
- async operations and pending auth flows currently need durable storage to become true multi-invocation server features
- split local-build preparation currently lives too much in CLI command code; it should move into a shared preparation layer reusable by CLI and TUI while still keeping raw local paths out of the server

## Remediation roadmap

The next architecture work should be delivered in the following order.

### Phase 1: declare the runtime contract

- update `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and this `PLAN.md` to describe Watchtower as a server-first system with local-only, remote-only, and split workflows
- document the two supported runtime modes: persistent server and ephemeral embedded
- define which commands/features are safe in ephemeral mode and which require persistence-aware runtime
- define which workflows require local preparation before calling the server
- make CLI messaging explicit when a user invokes a stateful workflow without a persistent server

### Phase 2: make stateful features durable

- add persistent implementations of `port.OperationStore`
- add persistent implementations of `port.LaunchpadPendingAuthFlowStore`
- keep in-memory implementations for tests and explicitly ephemeral mode
- wire the dedicated server to durable stores by default

### Phase 3: align CLI behavior with the runtime model

- keep the CLI as a first-class frontend that can do local preparation and call the server for remote execution
- prefer connecting to an existing configured server
- allow the CLI to start a background local server for stateful workflows when no server is configured
- reserve per-command embedded servers for stateless or explicitly non-durable workflows
- avoid keeping split-workflow preparation trapped inside Cobra command handlers

### Phase 4: restore the build API boundary

- move local-build preparation logic behind a shared application/frontend preparation layer reusable by CLI and TUI
- keep raw local paths and local filesystem concerns out of the server
- have local preparation produce stable prepared forge/build references that the server can execute durably
- reduce Launchpad-specific leakage in the main user-facing build API while preserving an explicit prepared-input contract for split workflows
- keep any low-level Launchpad-oriented controls separate from the normal user-facing build trigger contract

### Phase 5: shrink `internal/app`

- keep `internal/app` as the composition root
- extract config-to-policy logic into focused builders/factories for forge wiring, build wiring, package-source resolution, and project-sync configuration
- reduce `App`'s role as a service locator and move behavior into narrower units with explicit responsibilities

### Phase 6: harden API and test contracts

- audit Huma request structs so every optional slice/map/bool field is marked `required:"false"`
- add regression tests for omitted optional query/body fields
- remove host-environment assumptions from tests, especially loopback listener defaults and inherited git signing settings
- revalidate the documented baseline commands in a clean local environment

## Acceptance criteria for the remediation

- `watchtower auth login` can survive multiple CLI invocations when using a persistent server
- `watchtower build trigger --async` can be followed by `watchtower operation show <id>` across separate commands
- stateless commands still work without a pre-running server
- split workflows such as `build --source local --local-path ...` still perform local preparation on the client side and never require server-side filesystem access
- local preparation logic is reusable outside Cobra command code so the TUI can adopt the same behavior
- the public build API no longer requires Launchpad-specific resource identifiers for normal usage, while prepared-input execution remains available for split workflows
- `PLAN.md`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and the implemented runtime behavior describe the same architecture
- long-running operations now have an initial reusable in-memory async/progress/event foundation via `internal/core/service/operation` plus `internal/adapter/secondary/operationstore`
- `internal/app` should remain the composition root (wiring config, caches, clients, and services), not become the runtime API for every frontend
- API/CLI now adopt that foundation through `internal/adapter/primary/frontend`, with async build trigger + project sync wrappers and `/api/v1/operations` inspection/cancel endpoints; MCP/TUI still need to adopt the same model
- TUI/MCP will likely want the new dedicated frontend facade layer on top of the core services to become their main entrypoint, exposing frontend-friendly workflows rather than raw service-by-service access
- that facade would be the right place for cross-cutting concerns that frontends need but core services should not own directly: auth/session state, progress/events, async orchestration, cancellation, and view-oriented aggregation
